Problem:

What does bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 mean? I think it has something to do with bases.

Solution:

This looked like a Base64 encoded string. 
I copied the text bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 and pasted it into an online Base64 decoder.
After decoding it, I got the hidden message, which was the flag. 
It was a simple encoding challenge.
