Question:
Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

Solution:
To solve this, I needed to convert the number 42 from decimal to binary. I used the divide-by-2 method:

42 ÷ 2 = 21, remainder 0

21 ÷ 2 = 10, remainder 1

10 ÷ 2 = 5, remainder 0

5 ÷ 2 = 2, remainder 1

2 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 0

1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, I got 101010.
So the binary form of 42 is 101010.

and i submit picoCTF{101010}
