3.For the Netcat challenge, the task was to connect to the server jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org at port 41120 using the netcat (nc) tool to retrieve the flag. Netcat is a powerful networking utility that allows for reading and writing data across network connections using TCP or UDP protocols. To solve this, I first researched how to use netcat to establish a connection to a specific server and port. The syntax I used was nc [hostname] [port], and in this case, I ran the command nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 41120. This successfully connected me to the server, where I was greeted with a prompt or message that included the flag.
