1. Obedient Cat (picoCTF)
In this challenge, the goal was to retrieve a flag from a URL provided in the challenge description. To begin, I used the wget command to download the flag from the URL:
https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/217686fc11d733b80be62dcfcfca6c75/flag [with hint 2]. The command ran successfully, and the output indicated that the file had been saved as flag.2. Once the file was downloaded, I used the cat command to view the contents of the file:
cat flag.2. This displayed the flag, which was in the format:
picoCTF{flag_retrieved_successfully}. This flag was the solution to the challenge, confirming that I had completed it successfully.
