Question:
Can you connect to a remote server using SSH to get the flag?

The challenge tells us that using SSH (Secure Shell) is important, and we are given a username, a password, and a port to connect to the server.

Solution:
To solve this, I used the command:
ssh ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net -p 65335

When asked, I typed yes to accept the server fingerprint. Then I entered the password that was provided.
This showed the flag right there in the terminal, something like:
picoCTF{ssh_flag_retrieved}

That completed the SSH challenge successfully.
