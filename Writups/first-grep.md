Problem:
Description: Can you find the flag in the file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

Hint:
You can use command-line tools to search for the flag instead of manually going through the file.

Solution:
To solve this challenge, I first downloaded the file using wget. Once the file was saved on my system, I used the grep command to search for the flag in the file. The command I used was:

grep -i "pico" <filename>
This command searches the file for the string "pico" (case-insensitive). Since flags in picoCTF challenges often contain the term "picoCTF", this search efficiently helped me find the flag.

Once I ran the command, the flag appeared in the output, and I successfully retrieved it!
