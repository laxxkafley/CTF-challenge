🧩 Caesar — Spoken Write-up
✅ Solution

So for this one, the challenge name was Caesar, which already kind of gives a hint.
First thing I did was download the file using wget, and then I used cat to see what was inside.

When I opened it, I saw this:

picoCTF{bqnrrhmfsgdqtahbnmphkgrwqj}


At first glance, it didn’t look readable, but since the challenge is called Caesar, I knew it was probably a Caesar cipher. So what I did was take only the part inside the curly braces and ignore the picoCTF{} part.

Then I went to a Caesar cipher decoder website and tried shifting the text. After trying a few shifts, I finally got something that made sense

{crossingtherubiconqilhsxrk}




Once I saw that readable text, I knew it was correct. I put it back into the flag format and submitted it, and it worked.
