✅ Solution

For this challenge, I again started by downloading the file using wget and then used cat to read it.

The output looked like this:

YidkM0JxZGtwQlRYdHFhR3g2YUhsZmF6TnFlVGwzWVROclgyMHdNakV5TnpVNGZRPT0nCg==


Right away, it looked like Base64, because of the letters, numbers, and the == at the end. So I decoded it.

After decoding it once, I got:

b'd3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrX20wMjEyNzU4fQ=='


But this still looked like Base64. I noticed the b' ' part, so I removed that and decoded the string again.

After decoding it the second time, I got:

wpjvJAM{jhlzhy_k3jy9wa3k_m0212758}


At this point, the format with {} looked like a flag, but the text  was still not readable. So I it and tried a Caesar cipher decoder and try many shifts.

After applying the correct shift, it finally decoded to:

picoCTF{caesar_d3cr9pt3d_f0212758}


I submitted the flag, and it was correct.
